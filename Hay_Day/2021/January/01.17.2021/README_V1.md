# Hay Day January 17th 2021 session

I had a shorter Hay Day session today. Here are some notable things that happened during my session:

* The game frequently disconnected from the server (like it has been lately)

* I surpassed 1 million coins

* My phone crashed when going to the fishing area

* I did lots of product production

Those are the highlights from my January 17th 2021 Hay Day session.
