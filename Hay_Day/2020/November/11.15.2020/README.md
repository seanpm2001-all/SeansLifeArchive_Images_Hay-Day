# November 15th 2020 Hay Day session info

This file contains information about my November 15th 2020 Hay Day session.

I had a normal session today, playing late in the evening. I played on my Samsung Galaxy S20 FE (the first time playing this game on this device) I played a little extra, and ended up having to split the image files into 2 parts. The reason behind this is that I have recently found out a limitation in not paying for Degoo, which is that I can't upload files larger than 512 megabytes. I played a little bit longer today, and had to split the images into 2 zip files, so that I could upload it from my old phone.

I took a total of 391 pictures today. Remember that you can use these pictures for whatever you want, as long as you don't claim ownership and don't charge royalties (unless you are a developer at Supercell, even then, I still have some ownership rights) 

That is all the info for my November 15th 2020 Hay Day session
