# SeansLifeArchive_Images_Hay-Day
The module for my life story project that contains my Hay Day Gameplay images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my weekly Hay Day session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.hayday&hl=en_US&gl=US)

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing Hay Day all the way back in 2013. I started off with the [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hay-day/id506627515).

I started playing the game again a few times, from 2013 to 2014, then from 2014 to 2018, then again in 2020.
