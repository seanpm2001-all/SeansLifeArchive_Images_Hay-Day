### [Upload error] January 3rd 2021 data uploaded to January 10th 2021

I somehow uploaded all of January 3rd 2021s data to the January 10th 2021 directory. I still have not found a way to mass-move files in Git, but when I do, this is another issue that can be fixed with the missing method. The data for these 2 dates is swapped.
